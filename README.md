# Custom Registry Template

This repository is a template for creating a custom registry for Tracecat.

## Getting Started

1. Create your own repository from this template
2. Set environment variables in Tracecat

```
# In tracecat/.env
TRACECAT__REMOTE_REPOSITORY_URL=git+ssh://git@github.com/${MY_ORG}/${MY_REPO}.git
TRACECAT__REMOTE_REPOSITORY_PACKAGE_NAME=${MY_PACKAGE_NAME}

# Note: ${MY_ORG} and ${MY_REPO} are placeholders for your organization and repository name
# ${MY_PACKAGE_NAME} is the name of the python package
```

3. Create an public/private SSH key pair and add the public key to your repository deploy keys
4. Add org-level secret called `git-ssh-key` with the private key
5. Sync the repository in the registry table
